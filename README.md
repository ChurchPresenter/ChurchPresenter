This is a Kotlin Multiplatform project targeting Desktop (JVM).

* [/composeApp](./composeApp/src) is for code that will be shared across your Compose Multiplatform applications.
  It contains several subfolders:
    - [commonMain](./composeApp/src/commonMain/kotlin) is for code that's common for all targets.
    - Other folders are for Kotlin code that will be compiled for only the platform indicated in the folder name.
      For example, if you want to use Apple's CoreCrypto for the iOS part of your Kotlin app,
      the [iosMain](./composeApp/src/iosMain/kotlin) folder would be the right place for such calls.
      Similarly, if you want to edit the Desktop (JVM) specific part, the [jvmMain](./composeApp/src/jvmMain/kotlin)
      folder is the appropriate location.

## 🚀 Getting Started

This project uses Git submodules. Clone with:
```shell
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ChurchPresenter/ChurchPresenter
```

If you already cloned without submodules, run:
```shell
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

To pull the latest changes for all submodules:
```shell
git submodule update --remote --merge
```

> This will include [Lottie-Gen](https://github.com/ChurchPresenter/Lottie-Gen), a standalone tool for generating Lottie animations, located at `composeApp/src/jvmMain/appResources/common/Lottie-Gen`.

in your IDE's toolbar or run it directly from the terminal:

- on macOS/Linux
```shell
  ./gradlew :composeApp:run
```
- on Windows
```shell
  .\gradlew.bat :composeApp:run
```
